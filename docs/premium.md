:::note
We recommend prior knowledge of creating an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in order to follow along with these steps. If you need any help, feel free to shoot us a message via our Support Bot (**Helper#7371**) and we can try and provide extra support.
:::

**1.** Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click <mention>New Application</mention>

**2.** Give your bot a name, and click <mention>Create</mention>

**3.** Once you've completed those 2 steps, you should be on this page:
